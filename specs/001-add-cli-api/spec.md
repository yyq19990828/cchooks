# Feature Specification: CLI API Tools for Hook Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-cli-api`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add CLI api tools to easily create hooks to .claude/setting.json"
**Documentation**: [Claude Code Hooks Reference](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hook)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS

**Claude Code Settings File Format Compliance**:
- CLI tools MUST only modify the `hooks` section of settings.json
- CLI tools MUST NOT add, modify, or remove any other top-level fields
- Hook objects MUST only contain: `type`, `command`, `timeout` (optional)
- The `type` field is ALWAYS "command" (fixed per Claude Code spec)
- NO additional fields allowed in hook objects
- All existing non-hook settings MUST be preserved exactly as-is

**Exact Hook Structure**:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "EventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolPattern",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: CLI tools for hook management in .claude/settings.json
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers, Claude Code users
   � Actions: create, manage hooks
   � Data: hook configurations, .claude/settings.json
   � Constraints: CLI interface, JSON configuration format
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � RESOLVED: Support all 9 hook types (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd)
   � RESOLVED: Include update/delete operations in addition to creation
   � RESOLVED: Implement semantic validation using cchooks library types
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: developer adds hook via CLI command
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � CLI commands for hook management
   � Configuration file integration
   � Validation and error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Hook configurations, CLI commands, settings file
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties around scope and validation requirements"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Claude Code user and cchooks developer, I want CLI tools to easily add and manage hook configurations in my .claude/settings.json file, so that I can quickly set up hooks without manually editing JSON files and avoid configuration errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a Claude Code project with .claude/settings.json, **When** I run a CLI command to add a pre-tool-use hook, **Then** the hook is correctly added to the settings file with proper JSON structure
2. **Given** I have an existing .claude/settings.json with hooks, **When** I add a new hook via CLI, **Then** the existing hooks are preserved and the new hook is appended
3. **Given** I provide invalid hook configuration via CLI, **When** the command executes, **Then** I receive clear error messages and the settings file remains unchanged
4. **Given** .claude/settings.json doesn't exist, **When** I add a hook via CLI, **Then** the file is created with proper structure and the hook is added

### Edge Cases
- What happens when .claude directory doesn't exist?
- How does system handle malformed existing settings.json?
- What happens when trying to add duplicate hook configurations?
- How does system handle insufficient file permissions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide CLI commands to add hook configurations to .claude/settings.json
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate hook configurations before adding them to settings file
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve existing settings when adding new hooks
- **FR-004**: System MUST create .claude/settings.json if it doesn't exist
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- **FR-006**: System MUST support all 9 Claude Code hook types (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support create, update, and delete operations for hook configurations
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate hook configurations using semantic validation against cchooks library type definitions
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle file system errors gracefully (permissions, disk space)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain JSON formatting consistency in settings file
- **FR-011**: System MUST only modify the "hooks" section of settings.json files
- **FR-012**: System MUST NOT add, modify, or remove any fields outside the "hooks" section
- **FR-013**: Hook objects MUST only contain: "type" (always "command"), "command", "timeout" (optional)
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve all existing non-hook settings exactly as-is

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Hook Configuration**: Represents a single hook entry with type, command, and metadata
- **Settings File**: The .claude/settings.json file containing all Claude Code settings including hooks
- **CLI Command**: User interface for hook management operations
- **Validation Result**: Outcome of hook configuration validation with success/error details
