# Initialization Architect (Adaptive Version)

> No exposed parameters; internal adaptive three levels: quick summary / module scanning / deep supplementation. Ensures incremental updates and resumable runs with coverage reporting and next-step recommendations.

## I. General Constraints

- Do not modify source code; only generate/update documentation and `.claude/index.json`.
- **Ignore Rules Retrieval Strategy**:
  1. Prioritize reading the `.gitignore` file from the project root directory
  2. If `.gitignore` does not exist, use the following default ignore rules: `node_modules/**,.git/**,.github/**,dist/**,build/**,.next/**,__pycache__/**,*.lock,*.log,*.bin,*.pdf,*.png,*.jpg,*.jpeg,*.gif,*.mp4,*.zip,*.tar,*.gz`
  3. Merge ignore patterns from `.gitignore` with default rules
- For large files/binaries, only record paths without reading content.

## II. Staged Strategy (Automatic Intensity Selection)

1. **Stage A: Repository Census (Lightweight)**
   - Use multiple `Glob` calls in batches to get file inventory (avoid single-call limits), doing:
     - File counting, language proportions, directory topology, module candidate discovery (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, apps/_, packages/_, services/_, cmd/_, etc.).
   - Generate `Module Candidate List`, annotating each candidate module with: language, entry file guesses, test directory existence, config file existence.
2. **Stage B: Module Priority Scanning (Medium)**
   - For each module, try reading in the following order (batched, paginated):
     - Entry and startup: `main.ts`/`index.ts`/`cmd/*/main.go`/`app.py`/`src/main.rs`, etc.
     - External interfaces: routes, controllers, API definitions, proto/openapi
     - Dependencies and scripts: `package.json scripts`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, config directories
     - Data layer: `schema.sql`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, ORM models, migration directories
     - Testing: `tests/**`, `__tests__/**`, `*_test.go`, `*.spec.ts`, etc.
     - Quality tools: `eslint/ruff/golangci` configurations
   - Form "module snapshots", extracting only high-signal fragments and paths, not pasting large code blocks.
3. **Stage C: Deep Supplementation (Triggered As Needed)**
   - Trigger conditions (any one suffices):
     - Repository overall small (fewer files) or single module small file count;
     - After Stage B, still cannot determine key interfaces/data models/testing strategies;
     - Root or module `CLAUDE.md` missing information items.
   - Action: **Additional paginated reading** for target directories, filling gaps.

> Note: If pagination/attempts reach tool or time limits, must **write partial results early** and explain in summary "why stopped here" and "next-step recommended directory list".

## III. Artifacts and Incremental Updates

1.  **Write Root-level `CLAUDE.md`**
    - If exists, insert/update `Change Log (Changelog)` at the top.
    - Root structure (concise yet global):
      - Project Vision
      - Architecture Overview
      - **✨ New: Module Structure Diagram (Mermaid)**
        - Above the "Module Index" table, generate a Mermaid `graph TD` tree diagram based on identified module paths.
        - Each node should be clickable and link to the corresponding module's `CLAUDE.md` file.
        - Example syntax:

          ```mermaid
          graph TD
              A["(Root) My Project"] --> B["packages"];
              B --> C["auth"];
              B --> D["ui-library"];
              A --> E["services"];
              E --> F["audit-log"];

              click C "./packages/auth/CLAUDE.md" "View auth module docs"
              click D "./packages/ui-library/CLAUDE.md" "View ui-library module docs"
              click F "./services/audit-log/CLAUDE.md" "View audit-log module docs"
          ```

      - Module Index (table format)
      - Running and Development
      - Testing Strategy
      - Coding Standards
      - AI Usage Guidelines
      - Change Log (Changelog)

2.  **Write Module-level `CLAUDE.md`**
    - Place in each module directory, suggested structure:
      - **✨ New: Relative Path Breadcrumbs**
        - At the **top** of each module `CLAUDE.md`, insert a relative path breadcrumb line linking to parent directories and root `CLAUDE.md`.
        - Example (located at `packages/auth/CLAUDE.md`):
          `[Root Directory](../../CLAUDE.md) > [packages](../) > **auth**`
      - Module Responsibilities
      - Entry and Startup
      - External Interfaces
      - Key Dependencies and Configuration
      - Data Models
      - Testing and Quality
      - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
      - Related File List
      - Change Log (Changelog)
3.  **`.claude/index.json`**
    - Record: current timestamp (provided via parameters), root/module lists, entry/interface/test/important paths for each module, **scan coverage**, ignore statistics, whether truncated due to limits (`truncated: true`).

## IV. Coverage and Resumability

- Calculate and print each run:
  - Estimated total files, scanned file count, coverage percentage;
  - Coverage summary and gaps for each module (missing interfaces, tests, data models, etc.);
  - Top ignored/skipped directories and reasons (ignore rules/large files/time or call limits).
- Write "gap list" to `index.json`, prioritize filling gaps on next run (**breakpoint resumable scanning**).

## V. Result Summary (Print to Main Dialog)

- Root/module `CLAUDE.md` creation or update status;
- Module list (path + one-sentence responsibility);
- Coverage and major gaps;
- If not fully read: explain "why stopped here" and list **recommended next steps** (e.g., "suggest priority supplemental scanning: packages/auth/src/controllers, services/audit/migrations").

## VI. Time Format and Usage

- Use relative paths;
- Time information: Use the timestamp provided via command parameters and write in ISO-8601 format in `index.json`.
- Do not manually write time information; use the provided timestamp parameter to ensure time accuracy.
